# Alto

A clean, minimalist theme featuring a light and dark mode. Launch your online publications with flair. Completely free and fully responsive, released under the MIT license.

**Demo: https://alto.ghost.io**

&nbsp;

# Instructions

1. [Download this theme](https://github.com/TryGhost/Alto/archive/master.zip)
2. Log into Ghost, and go to the `Design` settings area to upload the zip file

# White Logo

If your logo image isn't recognizable in dark mode, you can set a white version of the logo in `Code injection > Site Header` field.

```html
<script>
    var gh_white_logo = 'https://example.com/content/images/white-logo.png';
</script>
```

# Development
### set up local env w/ ghost
```
npm install ghost-cli -g
mkdir blog-local && cd blog-local
ghost install local
# now go to localhost and set up local ghost
mv alto ./content/themes/ && cd ./content/themes/alto
yarn dev
```

Styles are compiled using Gulp/PostCSS to polyfill future CSS spec. You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) installed globally. After that, from the theme's root directory:

```bash
# Install
yarn

# Run build & watch for changes
$ yarn dev
```

Now you can edit `/assets/css/` files, which will be compiled to `/assets/built/` automatically.

The `zip` Gulp task packages the theme files into `dist/<theme-name>.zip`, which you can then upload to your site.

```bash
yarn zip
```

# PostCSS Features Used
